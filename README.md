# ProductionProject6
This project is a production log tracker that stores user entered products into a database 
and displays it to a product table, and a list view. A user can select the product from 
the list view as well as the quantity they want to produce. This adds the entry into another
database and displays the info of each product produced and the exact date and time it was produced.

This was an individual project that I worked on throughout my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast 
University which served as my object-oriented programming class's final.
